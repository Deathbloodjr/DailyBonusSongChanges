# DailyBonusSongChanges
| Mono | IL2CPP |

|✅|❌|

This is a mod for Taiko no Tatsujin: The Drum Master!\
It will enable changing the number of bonus songs available each day, as well as limiting what difficulties can appear as a bonus song.\
It has support for the Mono (1.2.2) version of the game. I attempted IL2CPP support, but it failed so far. If you wish to give it a shot, go for it.
